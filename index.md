## Introduction

Finding suitable boarding places is often difficult due to scattered information and limited accessibility. **MyStay** centralizes this information, allowing users to search, filter, and view boarding listings based on location, price, and availability. Landlords can efficiently manage their listings through the platform.

---

## Solution Architecture

MyStay follows a modular and scalable architecture. The system supports multiple user roles (tenants and landlords), secure authentication, listing management, and search functionality. The architecture ensures maintainability, reliability, and future scalability.

## Conclusion

MyStay provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for discovering and managing boarding places. By centralizing information, it reduces the effort required to find accommodation and offers landlords a structured way to manage listings. Future developments may include mobile apps, AI-based recommendation systems, and expanded coverage.
