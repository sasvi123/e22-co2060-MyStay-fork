## Introduction
Finding suitable boarding places is often difficult due to scattered information and limited accessibility. **MyStay** centralizes this information, allowing users to search, filter, and view boarding listings based on location, price, and availability. Landlords can efficiently manage their listings through the platform.

## Solution Architecture
MyStay follows a modular and scalable architecture. The system supports multiple user roles (tenants and landlords), secure authentication, listing management, and search functionality. The architecture ensures maintainability, reliability, and future scalability.

---

## Software Designs
The design focuses on usability, responsiveness, and clean user interaction flows. Core screens include the homepage, search results, listing details, and authentication pages. The platform follows UI/UX best practices, ensuring accessibility across devices.

## Testing
<!-- Testing section will be updated later -->
*Testing is currently in progress and will be added here once complete.*

## Conclusion
MyStay provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for discovering and managing boarding places. By centralizing information, it reduces the effort required to find accommodation and offers landlords a structured way to manage listings. Future developments may include mobile apps, AI-based recommendation systems, and expanded coverage.
